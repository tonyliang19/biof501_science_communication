## Protein and their structure

- Molecular element that ...
- Involved in every important activity that happens inside every living thing
- Protein folding matters but hard to solve
- We knew 3D structures for only about 17% of roughly 20000 proteins in the human body



## How do we know protein structure?

Maybe spend some money and do some lab work?

. . .

Tedious experimental methods like


::: {.incremental}

-  X-ray crystallography 
- cryo-electron microscopy
- NMR spectroscopy
- We mean `multi-million` dollars and **months** or even **years**

## Alphafold

- Fun story: Rise from a competition "Olympics for protein folding"
  - Given one dimensional amino acid sequence, can you predict the protein structure?
- Artificial Intelligence tool that predicts protein structure from sequence.
- Very well prediction to be within width about one atom
- We know have ....

## Future with Alphafold

- I dont know
