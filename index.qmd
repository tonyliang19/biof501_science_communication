## What is protein?

- Building blocks of life.
- Involved in every important activity that happens inside every living thing.
- We know very few 3D structures of unique proteins, and through long time of studies.

::: {.notes}

- Make analogy of think of proteins like tiny machines in the body that help build, repair, and protect.

- Protein [**function**]{.primary} is closely related to its structure.

- So, knowing [**structure**]{.primary} helps scientists design new medicines and understand diseases.

- Figuring out a protein's structure is extremely hard.

- It's like solving 3D puzzle with thousands of pieces, yet [without knowing]{.quaternary} what the final picture looks like.

- Usually done by long time and expensive experiments.

Like how the shape of a key fits a lock, a protein's shape determines how it interacts with other molecules.

::: {.column width="42%"}

- Rise from a competition "Olympics for protein folding"
  - Given an amino acid sequence, can you predict its protein structure?
- **Artificial Intelligence** algorthim, fully computational
- Very well prediction with [atomic accuracy]{.secondary}.

## How Alphafold works

![Fig. 3: Basic workflow of Alphafold.](figures/alphafold-process.png)

Alphafold can predict the potential structure from an amino acid sequence, [**super fast**]{.secondary} with fairly [**high accuracy**]{.secondary}.
