## What is protein?

- Building blocks of life.
- Involved in every important activity that happens inside every living thing
- Protein folding matters but hard to solve
- We knew 3D structures for only about 17% of roughly 20000 proteins in the human body

::: {.notes}

- Make analogy of think of proteins like tiny machines in the body that help build, repair, and protect.

- Protein [**function**]{.primary} is closely related to its structure.

- So, knowing [**structure**]{.primary} helps scientists design new medicines and understand diseases.

- Figuring out a protein's structure is extremely hard.

- It's like solving 3D puzzle with thousands of pieces, yet [without knowing]{.quaternary} what the final picture looks like.

- Usually done by long time and expensive experiments.

Like how the shape of a key fits a lock, a protein's shape determines how it interacts with other molecules.

## Alphafold

- Fun story: Rise from a competition "Olympics for protein folding"
  - Given one dimensional amino acid sequence, can you predict the protein structure?
- Artificial Intelligence tool that predicts protein structure from sequence.
- Very well prediction to be within width about one atom
- We know have ....

## Future with Alphafold

- I dont know
