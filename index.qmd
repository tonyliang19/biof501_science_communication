## What is protein?

- Building blocks of life.
- Involved in every important activity that happens inside every living thing.
  - Muscle movement
  - Digestion
  - Oxygen transport
  - And **more** . . .


::: {.notes}

- Make analogy of think of proteins like tiny machines in the body that help build, repair, and protect.

## What's special of protein structure? {.nostretch}

- Protein [**function**]{.primary} is closely related to its structure.

- So, knowing [**structure**]{.primary} helps scientists design new medicines and understand diseases.

- Figuring out a protein's structure is extremely hard.

- It's like solving 3D puzzle with thousands of pieces, yet [without knowing]{.quaternary} what the final picture looks like.

- Usually done by long time and expensive experiments.

- Like how the shape of a key fits a lock, a protein's shape determines how it interacts with other molecules.

- We know very few 3D structures of unique proteins, and through long time of studies.

- Protein are composed by these various small elements amino acids, combination of these can determine its 3D structure, thus its function

## How Alphafold works

![Fig. 2: Basic workflow of Alphafold.](figures/alphafold-process.png)

Alphafold can predict the potential structure from an amino acid sequence, [**super fast**]{.secondary} with fairly [**high accuracy**]{.secondary}.

## Alphafold

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="42%"}

- Rise from a competition "Olympics for protein folding"
  - Given an amino acid sequence, can you predict its protein structure?
- **Artificial Intelligence** algorthim, fully computational
- Very well prediction with [atomic accuracy]{.secondary}.

- X asis were top 15 groups out of 146 groups, performance of the CASP14 dataset (n = 87 protein domains)

- Y asis is median root mean squared deviation, similarity between atomic coordinates

- Rise from 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)

- Before alpha, only small fraction (i.e. 100K of billions) of unique protein structure determined
