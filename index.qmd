## Protein and their structure

- Molecular element that ...

- We know nothing about its structure



## How do we know protein structure?

-  X-ray crystallography 
- cryo-electron microscopy
- NMR spectroscopy

- These are slow, expensive, limited


# Thanks to magical AI {.highlight}


## Alphafold

- Fun story: how this came up initially
- Easily tell what is protein structure
- What could be done with this

## Future with Alphafold

- I dont know
